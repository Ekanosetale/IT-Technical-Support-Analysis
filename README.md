**Executive Summary: Technical Support Analysis Report**

**Introduction** 
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of technical support operations based on the dataset provided. The objective is to examine key performance indicators (KPIs) related to ticket volume, content, resolution, and overall performance, in line with the focus areas outlined in the brief. The report will highlight trends in ticket creation, resolution times, agent performance, and adherence to Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

1. **Ticket Volume Trends:**

Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Volumes: The analysis reveals that ticket volumes are higher on weekdays compared to weekends, with the majority of tickets being created during standard work hours. A significant drop in ticket volumes is observed during weekends and non-working hours, indicating a peak in ticket creation during regular business days and times.
Ticket Distribution: The distribution of tickets is skewed towards standard work hours, with 41.4% of tickets created during these times. Non-work hours see a reduced ticket volume, with late and early work hours contributing to only 16.9% of total tickets.

**Trends in Ticket Topics:**

Tickets are predominantly related to "Product setup" and "Pricing and licensing," followed by "Feature requests" and "Bug reports." This suggests a strong demand for support in product onboarding and pricing-related queries.
First Response and Resolution Times: While 86.65% of tickets met the SLA for first response, the resolution SLA adherence is lower, with only 66.39% of tickets resolved within the target SLA. This indicates a need for improvement in resolution times, especially for high-priority tickets.
Channel Comparison: The majority of tickets are raised via email (53%), followed by chat (36.5%) and phone (10.6%). However, chat tickets have the highest SLA violation rate, suggesting that real-time support channels might need further optimization to meet SLA targets.
3. **Performance Metrics:**

SLA Adherence: The overall SLA adherence for first responses stands at 86.65%, with 13.35% of tickets violating the SLA. The resolution SLA is violated more frequently, with 33.61% of tickets failing to meet the target time.
Agent Performance: Agents like Nicola Wane and Sheela Cutten have high ticket volumes with commendable SLA adherence. However, Kristos Westoll and Adolpho Messingham show higher SLA violations, indicating areas for performance improvement. The average rating of agent interactions varies, with higher ratings typically correlating with better SLA adherence.
**Conclusion:**
 At the executive level, the focus should be on improving SLA adherence, particularly for ticket resolution times, and optimizing support channels to reduce SLA violations. Efforts should be made to address the high volume of tickets related to "Product setup" and "Pricing and licensing," as these areas significantly impact customer satisfaction. Regular monitoring of agent performance and targeted training for underperforming agents can help enhance overall efficiency and service quality.

**Recommendations:**

Enhance SLA Adherence: Implement stricter monitoring and automated alerts to ensure timely responses and resolutions, particularly for high-priority tickets.
Optimize Support Channels: Invest in improving chat support to reduce SLA violations and enhance customer experience in real-time interactions.
Agent Training and Development: Provide targeted training for agents with higher SLA violation rates and focus on areas where tickets are most frequent, such as product setup.
